# Stardew_Valley_Mods

Notice!!!: As of July 8th 2016 All of my old work has been put into the Stardew Valley Mods folder and can be found there. I have started a new modding approach based off my original goal of modding, making content I actually want to see in the game. This approach could include anything from small 20 line code projects to something a bit more serious. These more personal projects can be found in the Stadew Valley Mods-Back to Basics folder if you want them.

Here is a list/home of all of my works that I have done for Stardew Valley. Feel free to use them however you like, and if you use my code in making another mod please make sure to give credit to me as it helps get the word out about my work. Seriously, go have fun and stop reading this.

You have credit to do whatever you wish with these files incase I go MIA for some reason. Untill then I'll handle them myself.
