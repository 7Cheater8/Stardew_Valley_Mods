Custom_Shop_Mod_Redux_GUI v 1.0.0

For SDV 1.0.7 and SMAPI v0.40

This is the custom_shop_mod_redux which is a second, much better attempt at adding custom shops into StardewValley!

***Not to be confused with the custon_shop_mod which was it's precessor and was based around the SMAPI console.

Basically making a custom shop is as simple as following the formatting in the pre-existsing custom_shops in a new text file.

You can access these custom shops by pressing a key. (The U key by default, which is configurable in the config file)

Make sure the formatting is correct otherwise you will get errors!

Have fun with this one! I hope to see all of the custom shops that you all put out!


If you wish to call this mod in your own mod without the menu the code would be

Custom_Shop_Mod_Redux.Class1.external_shop_file_call(path, filename);

Where path is the directory path of the desired text file, and filename is the name of the file inside of the path directory.

*Note that path will not include the file itself. The code will take care of that for you.
