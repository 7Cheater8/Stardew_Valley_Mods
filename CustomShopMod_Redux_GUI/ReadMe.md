This is the custom_shop_mod_redux which is a second, much better attempt at adding custom shops into StardewValley!

***Not to be confused with the custon_shop_mod which was it's precessor and was based around the SMAPI console.

Basically making a custom shop is as simple as following the formatting in the pre-existsing custom_shops in a new text file.

Make sure the formatting is correct otherwise you will get errors!

Have fun with this one! I hope to see all of the custom shops that you all put out!
