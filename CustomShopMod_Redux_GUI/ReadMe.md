Custom_Shop_Mod_Redux_GUI v 1.0.0

For SDV 1.0.7 and SMAPI v0.40

This is the custom_shop_mod_redux which is a second, much better attempt at adding custom shops into StardewValley!

***Not to be confused with the custon_shop_mod which was it's precessor and was based around the SMAPI console.

Basically making a custom shop is as simple as following the formatting in the pre-existsing custom_shops in a new text file.

If you ever wish to call the mod without the menu in your own mod, simply call shop_file_call("myfilename.txt") in your Stardew Valley Mod.
(Make sure you add a reference to this mod.)

The full call would look something like.

Custom_Shop_Mod_Redux.Class1.shop_file_call("file.txt");

Where file.txt is the name of the shop info you wish to open.

Make sure the formatting is correct otherwise you will get errors!

Have fun with this one! I hope to see all of the custom shops that you all put out!
