This is the MoreRain mod, which can increase or decrease how much it rains in your game as well as increase the chance to get lightning! 

It will not rain on days where a weather effect besides raining, lightning, sunny weather would occur such as a holiday or a festival. It will ignore snow atm. 

The check for tomorrow's forcast takes place upon loading, and upon each new day. 

The 1st % chance is for it to rain the next day is stored in MoreRain.txt The 2nd % chance is for it to be a lightning storm the next day if it would rain the next day as set by the first numerical value. Both can be edited in Config.json.
