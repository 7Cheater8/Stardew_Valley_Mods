# AutoSpeed_Mod
v0.0.3 3/6/16
-Updated to SMAPI 0.0.7

This is a simple .dll mod for SVAPI which automatically changes the character's speed value referenced in AutoSpeed.txt.
This basically just bypasses having to type in the command everytime you load SVAPI.

This must be loaded into Stardew Valley/Mods
where Stardew Valley is the directory where StardewModdingAPI.exe is located.
