Updates:
1.1.0
-Updated to SDV 1.1

1.0.0
-Finally got around to an offical full release of this mod. Basically rewrote it from the ground up.

Description
This is the MoreRain mod, which can increase or decrease how much it rains in your game as well as increase the chance to get lightning storms!
I basically wrote this mod a long time ago because some people complained about the rain in Stardew Valley being too spotty, so this adds in a new level of control to the game.

It will not rain on days where a wedding or a festival would take place, so this mod will ignore those days.

All of the values that can be configured in More_Rain_Config.txt
