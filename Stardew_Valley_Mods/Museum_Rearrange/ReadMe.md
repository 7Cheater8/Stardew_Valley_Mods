-Massively rewrote some code because it was super necessary.
-Fixed some typoes with the config files.

This is the museum rearranger mod! This mod allows you to rearrange the museum without having to have something to donate!

Simply press the R key while inside the museum and you will be able to make the museum look however you like!

That's pretty much it. I haven't found any issues thus far, so feel free to go at it!
