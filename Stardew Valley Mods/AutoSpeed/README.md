# AutoSpeed_Mod
v0.0.4 3/27/16
-Updated to SMAPI 0.3.9.1

-Updated to the most recent version of SMAPI.

-No longer requires the trainer mod to run!

-General code clean up.

This is a simple .dll mod for SMAPI which automatically changes the character's speed value referenced in AutoSpeed.txt.
This basically just bypasses having to type in the command everytime you load SMAPI.

Install in by putting it into Stardew Valley/Mods/AutoSpeed!
