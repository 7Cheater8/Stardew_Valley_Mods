For SDV 1.07 and SMAPI 0.40 (Should work as long as the api isn't dramatically changed)

-Fixed a bug where the game would crash when pressing the bound key on the character creation menu and title screen.

This is the museum rearranger mod! This mod allows you to rearrange the museum without having to have something to donate!

Simply press the R key while inside the museum and you will be able to make the museum look however you like!

That's pretty much it. I haven't found any issues thus far, so feel free to go at it!
