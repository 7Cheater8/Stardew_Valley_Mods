[Storm]BuildHealth-v0.0.1 3/10/16 7:45 PM PST

-Initial Release

This is the BuildHealth mod, which can increase your max health in a couple of different ways! As you partake in the tasks below, you gain xp points, and when you reach enough xp points, your max health will increase!

Ways to increase maximum health

1. Use tools.

2. Eating Food.

3. Sleeping!

I'm up to a few more suggestions as well that can add to this list.

All of the data can be set up/edited in BuildHealth_Config.tx. If you want to increase/decrease any of the values such as the xp to level up, the maximum level, or even the amount of health you gain upon level up can be found here.

All data values currently associated with the character can also be change around with BuildHealth_data.txt

NOTE! If at any time you want to remove/reverse the properties set by this mod, open up the BuildHealth_data.txt file and set the value associated with resetting the mod data to true! This will revert the player's max health to the value initially stored when the mod was installed/ the value associate with old health.
