# MoreRain
This is the MoreRain mod, which can increase or decrease how much it rains in your game. It will not rain on days where a weather effect besides raining and sunny weather would occur such as a holiday or a festival. It will also ignore if it would snow, or have a thunderstorm as well.
The check for tomorrow's forcast takes place upon loading, and upon each new day.
The % chance for it to rain the next day is stored in MoreRain.txt
