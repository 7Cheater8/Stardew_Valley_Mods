**Stardew Symphony** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you add music
packs to Stardew Valley and play them without editing the game's default sound files.

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.2+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

## Installation
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/425).
