This is the custom shop mod!

Basically making a custom shop is as simple as following the formatting in the pre-existsing custom_shops in a new text file.

If you ever wish to call the mod without the menu in your own mod, simply call shop_file_call("myfilename.txt") in your Stardew Valley Mod.
(Make sure you add a reference to this mod.)

The full call would look something like.

Custom_Shop_Mod_Redux.Class1.shop_file_call("file.txt");

Where file.txt is the name of the shop info you wish to open.

Make sure the formatting is correct otherwise you will get errors!
